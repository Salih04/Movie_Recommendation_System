# Content-Based Movie Recommendation System

This project is a content-based movie recommendation system built using Python and C++. The system recommends movies to users based on their preferences by analyzing movie features such as genres and title.

## Features

- **Content-Based Filtering:** Recommends movies based on the content similarity to what the user has liked in the past.
- **Hybrid Implementation:** Combines the strengths of Python for machine learning and data manipulation with C++ for efficient data processing.
- **Customizable:** Easily extendable to include more features or use other recommendation strategies.

## Technologies Used

- **Python:** For machine learning, data processing, and recommendation logic.
- **C++:** For performance-critical operations and data handling.
- **Libraries:** 
  - Python: `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `numpy`.
  - C++: `iostream`, `fstream` `vector` `sstream` `algorithm` `string` `map`.
