Content-Based Movie Recommendation System
This project is a content-based movie recommendation system built using Python and C++. The system recommends movies to users based on their preferences by analyzing movie features such as genre, director, actors, and plot descriptions.

Features
Content-Based Filtering: Recommends movies based on the content similarity to what the user has liked in the past.
Hybrid Implementation: Combines the strengths of Python for machine learning and data manipulation with C++ for efficient data processing.
Customizable: Easily extendable to include more features or use other recommendation strategies.
Technologies Used
Python: For machine learning, data processing, and recommendation logic.
C++: For performance-critical operations and data handling.
Libraries:
Python: pandas, scikit-learn, numpy, NLTK (for text processing), Flask (if deploying as a web app).
C++: Standard Library, and any other necessary libraries for data processing.
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Kodu kopyala
git clone https://github.com/your-username/movie-recommendation-system.git
cd movie-recommendation-system
Set up the Python environment:

bash
Kodu kopyala
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
pip install -r requirements.txt
Build the C++ components:

Navigate to the cpp directory and run the makefile or compile the C++ code using:
bash
Kodu kopyala
g++ -o main main.cpp -std=c++11
Usage
Prepare the Dataset:

Ensure the movie dataset (e.g., CSV or JSON format) is placed in the data directory.
The dataset should include features like movie titles, genres, descriptions, etc.
Run the Recommendation System:

Execute the main script which combines Python and C++ components:
bash
Kodu kopyala
python main.py
Alternatively, if you need to run specific C++ modules, compile and execute them as needed.
Accessing Results:

Recommendations will be displayed in the console or saved to an output file, depending on your implementation.
